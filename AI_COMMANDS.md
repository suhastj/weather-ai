# AI Interaction Prompts

This file documents all the prompts used to interact with the AI assistant during the development of the Weather AI project. This file is automatically updated during AI Agent mode interactions.

## Development Prompts

1. **Adding a new GET endpoint with name parameter** (2024-03-21)
```
write a new GET method which accepts 'name' param, and responds with a new string of format 'hello $name'
```

2. **Creating test cases for the new endpoint** (2024-03-21)
```
write test case for /greet method and add to corresponding spec file
```

3. **Creating service test file** (2024-03-21)
```
create a spec file for app.service.ts and add corresponding test cases
```

4. **Documenting commands** (2024-03-21)
```
create a new file and add all the commands I have used to interact with you for this project
```

5. **Documenting prompts** (2024-03-21)
```
create ai_commands.md file and add all the 'prompts' I have provided so far
```

6. **Setting up automatic documentation** (2024-03-21)
```
On every 'prompt' I provide during the AI Agent mode (not during Ask or Manual mode), keep updated ai_commands.md and commands.md file
```

7. **Renaming documentation file** (2024-03-21)
```
suggest a better name for Commands.md file based on it's content
```

## Note
These prompts were used to:
- Add new functionality to the application
- Create and maintain test cases
- Document the development process
- Keep track of interactions with the AI assistant

Each prompt resulted in specific changes to the codebase, which are documented in the `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` file.

## Update Process
- This file is automatically updated during AI Agent mode interactions
- Each prompt is timestamped for better tracking
- The file maintains a chronological order of all interactions
- Related changes to the codebase are documented in `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md`
